The overall goal of the project is to create suspense and unease through level design, audio, animation systems, and scripted events.

## Features

- First-person player movement
- Camera control system
- Flashlight interaction and pickup system
- Door interaction and trigger-based events
- Flickering light effects for horror atmosphere
- Main menu and pause menu systems
- Note pickup / interaction system
- Teleport or trigger controller logic

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**
- **C#**
- **TextMesh Pro**
- Animation controllers and `.anim` clips
- Audio effects
- Environment and prop assets
- Scripted gameplay events

## Gameplay Systems

The project includes several gameplay systems implemented through C# scripts and Unity animation assets.

### Player Systems
- `PlayerMovement.cs` handles player movement.
- `PlayerCam.cs` and `MoveCam.cs` manage camera behavior and viewing control.

### Interaction Systems
- `FlashLightPickUp.cs` supports flashlight pickup behavior.
- `Doorbehavior.cs` and `DoorTriggering.cs` control door interaction and trigger-based events.
- `NotePickUP.cs` supports collectible or readable note interactions.

### Animation Systems
- The `ANIMATIONS` folder contains animation clips and controllers for object interactions such as doors, toilet doors, drawers, curtains, and nearby environment objects.
- Files such as `DoorOpen.anim`, `DoorClose.anim`, `DoorOpen_toilet.anim`, and `DoorClose_toilet.anim` indicate animated environmental interactions.
- Controllers such as `Main_Doors.controller` and `Toilet_Door.controller` are used to manage animation state transitions.
- Additional animation folders such as `DrawerToForward1`, `DrawerToLeft`, `DrawerToRight`, `NearClockDrawer`, `NearCouchDrawer`, `Toilet`, and `UnderJesusPickDrawer` suggest multiple animated interaction points in the environment.

### Atmosphere Systems
- `Flickering.cs` and `LightLampON_OFF.cs` contribute to lighting-based horror effects.
- `footstepsController.cs` supports movement-related audio feedback.
- `MainMenu.cs` and `PauseMenu.cs` manage UI flow and game state transitions.
